## Standard issue nerd

I'm Stephen. I build online things using [boring technologies](https://boringtechnology.club/) which I secretly find quite exciting. For the past few years I've mostly been **programming Elixir**, which I think means I'm cool now.

Way back when, I used to make offline things, mostly furniture :chair:

I [blog](http://stephenlewis.me/blog) sporadically, and [stream](https://twitch.tv/stephencodes) even less. I'm also really, really bad at chess, much to my annoyance.
